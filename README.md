# Coffee-Machine
☕ Coffee Machine Program (Python)

A text-based coffee machine simulation enabling users to place drink orders handle payments verify ingredient supply and refresh the machine’s stock.

Perfect for practicing functions, dictionaries, loops, and modular code in Python.

🚀 Features

✔️ Menu with 3 drinks: Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino

✔️ Ingredient management (water, milk, coffee)

✔️ Tracks machine resources

✔️ Accepts coins and calculates total amount

✔ Verifies sufficient resources are available prior, to preparing a drink

✔️ Gives back change if the amount paid exceeds the price of the drink

✔️ Reports current resource levels

✔️ Powered off with a simple command

🧠 How the Program Works

A prompt appears on the machine:

“What is your preference? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): ”

User enters:

A valid drink → machine processes it

"report" → displays resources at present

"off" → shuts down the machine

Upon selecting a beverage:

The machine verifies if there is an amount of water, milk and coffee available

The user deposits coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)

The program computes:

Amount of money deposited

Whether it's enough

Change to return

Components are subtracted

Final message → “Here is your ☕ enjoy!”

📘 Abilities Gained Through This Project

Building this project strengthens:

Python dictionaries

Nested dictionary access

Functions & returning values

Repeating until the program ends

Logical problem solving

Simulating a real-world process in code

This is among the beginner/intermediate Python tasks since it compels you to approach problems, like an engineer.

🛠️ Possible Improvements (Optional)

You have the option to enhance your coffee machine with:

☕ Add more drinks

🔋 Add refill functionality

💰 Use classes (OOP version)

🎛 GUI version using Tkinter

🌐 API-based order system

📱 Coffee machine mobile app simulation

🧠 AI-powered recommendation system
